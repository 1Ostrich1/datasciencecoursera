#Glob patterns are like simplified regular expressions that shells use. 
#An asterisk (*) matches zero or more characters; 
#[abc] matches any character inside the brackets (in this case a, b, or c); a question mark (?) matches a single character; #and brackets enclosing characters separated by a hyphen([0-9]) 
#matches any character in the range (in this case 0 through 9) .
